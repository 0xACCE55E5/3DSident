Originally created by wolfvak - It was initially intended to be a small application for the Nintendo 3DS to check your current FIRM and OS version.

I decided to fork this project, and added additional info similar to PSPident, hence the name 3DSident.

# Features:
- Current FIRM and OS version detection.
- Model detection.
- Region detection.
- Language detection.
- MAC address detection.
- SD detection.
- Battery status.
